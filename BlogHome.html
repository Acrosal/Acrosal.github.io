    Ever since I was a young teen, I have always found an interest in using computers. Fascinated by how they worked and wanting to learn more, I soon started experimenting with my own.
    Long story short, I ended up with a broken computer and knowledge about static electricity. A sad event for some became just a small hiccup in my pursuit of knowledge, as I worked hard to get
    another computer to get right back at it. I soon was learning how to completely disassemble and put computers back together. I have been working on computers and learning more about technology
    for over a decade as a hobby of mine. That is why I would love to turn that hobby into a real-life career. As we all know, the tech market is booming right now, and it's only going to grow exponentially larger!
